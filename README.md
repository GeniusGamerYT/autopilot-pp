Autopilot++
===========

Autopilot++ is an unofficial plugin for GEFS-Online (http://www.gefs-online.com), the free flight simulator based on the Google Earth Plugin. It provides new mode settings for the autopilot currently in the simulator, as well as other minor changes.

We recommend using Google Earth Plugin v6.2.2.6613, as later versions use a new terrain data model which makes GEFS unusuable.
