Contributing to GEFS Plugins
============================

Before you can contribute to the GEFS Plugins project, you'll need to sign a
Contributor Licence Agreement (or CLA for short).  It helps to ensure the
rights of everyone: the users, myself and you as a contributor.  It isn't
difficult to complete and shouldn't be much of a hassle (if it is, sorry!).

GEFS Plugins Contributor Licence Agreement
------------------------------------------
_Version 1.0 (January 5, 2014)_

### Preface

To prevent issues concerning the intellectual property licensing and copyright
disputes relating to contributions to the GEFS Plugins project, a Contributor
Licence Agreement is needed to be kept as a record of your agreement to the
terms and conditions of contributing to the GEFS Plugins project.

This Contributor Licence Agreement protects your rights by: (1) asserting the
copyright of your contributions, as well as the work of the GEFS Plugins team
as a whole, (2) allow others from using your contributions without fear of
legal disputes, and (3) allowing the GEFS Plugins team to use these
contributions for the public benefit.

__Please read this document carefully before signing this Contributor Licence
Agreement and keep a copy of this document for your records.__

The terms and conditions of this Contributor Licence Agreement follow.

### TERMS AND CONDITIONS

 1. __Definitions.__

    This Contributor Licence Agreement shall incorporate the
    definitions from the Apache License, version 2.0, except
    where otherwise defined in this Contributor Licence Agreement.

    "Agreement" shall mean the terms and conditions of contributing to the
    GEFS Plugins project, as defined by sections 1 to 11 of this document.

    "Licensor" shall mean the individual Karl Cheng.

    "you" (or "your") shall mean the individual or Legal
    Entity who is making this Agreement.

    "Licensee" shall mean a recipient of software distributed by the Licensor.

    "Work" shall mean the work of authorship by the Licensor,
    whether in Source or Object form, as indicated by a copyright
    notice that is included in or attached to the work.

    "Applicable Laws" shall mean all laws, statutes, constitutions,
    rules, regulations, principles of common law, resolutions, codes,
    ordinances, requirements, judgements, orders, decrees, injunctions,
    and writs of any Governmental Entity which apply to this Agreement.

    "Third-Party Creation" shall mean a Contribution not submitted
    to the Licensor by the copyright owner.  For the purposes
    of this definition, "submitted" shall have the same
    meaning as in the definition of the term "Contribution".

 2. __Overriding Laws.__

    The conditions of this Agreement shall not apply
    only to the extent that they are inconsistent with
    Applicable Laws in your country of residence.

    If any of the conditions of this Agreement are invalid, illegal
    or unenforceable, those conditions will be read down to the
    extent necessary to ensure that they are not invalid, illegal or
    unenforceable, but if that is not possible, they will be severed
    from this Agreement and the other conditions will remain valid.

 3. __Entitlement to Acceptance.__

    You represent that you are legally entitled to make this Agreement
    with the Licensor.  If your employer(s) has rights to intellectual
    property that you create that includes your Contributions, you
    represent that you have received permission to make Contributions
    on behalf of that employer, that your employer has waived such
    rights for your Contributions to the Licensor, or that your
    employer has executed a separate Agreement with the Licensor.

 4. __Termination of Agreement.__

    If you have become aware of any facts or circumstances which have made your
    representations to the Licensor related to this Agreement inaccurate in
    any respect, you agree to notify the Licensor know as soon as practicable.

    This Agreement may be terminated by you at any time, or by the Licensor
    if it has been found that you have materially misrepresented facts or
    circumstances relating to your capability to carry out this Agreement.

    For Contributions intentionally submitted to the Licensor before
    the termination of this Agreement, provisions granted under this
    Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

 5. __Third-Party Creations.__

    Any Third-Party Creation shall be submitted separately from any
    other Contribution, submitted with all known information regarding
    the source of the Third-Party Creation and restrictions (including,
    but not limited to, related copyright details, licence agreements,
    patents and trademarks), and be conspicuously marked as:

        Submitted on behalf of a third party: <insert name>

    By submitting a Third-Party Creation to the Licensor, you affirm
    and declare that to the best of your knowledge and belief, the
    Third-Party Creation follows the terms of this Agreement, including
    the granting of copyright and patent licences to the Licensor.

 6. __Grant of Copyright Licence.__

    Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you grant
    to the Licensor a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
    royalty-free, irrevocable copyright licence to reproduce, prepare
    Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense,
    and distribute your Contribution(s) in Source or Object form.

 7. __Grant of Patent Licence.__

    Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you grant to the
    Licensor a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
    irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent licence to make,
    have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer
    the Work, where such licence applies only to those patent claims
    licensable by you that are necessarily infringed by your Contribution(s)
    alone or by combination of your Contribution(s) with the Work to which
    your Contribution(s) was submitted.  If the Licensor or a Licensee
    institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim
    or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that your Contribution(s) or a
    Work incorporating a Contribution of your creation constitutes direct
    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licences granted
    to the Licensor or Licensee under this Agreement for that Work or
    Contribution shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

 8. __Submission of Contributions.__

    Unless you explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally
    submitted for inclusion in the Work by you to the Licensor shall be
    under the terms and conditions of this Agreement, without any additional
    terms or conditions.  Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall
    supersede or modify the terms of any separate licence agreement you
    may have executed with the Licensor regarding such Contributions.

 9. __Disclaimer of Warranty.__

    Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, you
    provide your Contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR
    CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without
    limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
    MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

 10. __Limitation of Liability.__

    In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including
    negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law
    (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing,
    shall you be liable to the Licensor or a Licensee for damages, including
    any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of
    any character arising as a result of this Agreement or out of the use
    or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages
    for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction,
    or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if you have
    advised the Licensor or a Licensee of the possibility of such damages.

 11. __Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.__

    You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support,
    warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights
    for your Contribution(s) consistent with this Agreement.  However, in
    accepting such obligations, you may act only on your own behalf and on
    your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only
    if you agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for
    any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor
    by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
